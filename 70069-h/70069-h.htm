LITTLE CHILD</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE ARTIST</p>


<p>He stood with bare feet planted well
apart in the sand, working his toes down
comfortably into its moist warmth and
regarding Graham as though he were a
poor riddle. His cotton blouse, open at
the throat, showed a strong, shapely
little neck. One brown hand grasped a
battered tin pail, the other a wooden
spade.</p>

<p>Gilbert Graham drew out pad and
pencil and made a rapid sketch. The
child’s clear gaze remained fixed on his
face while he worked. When the drawing
was finished, the artist thrust it carelessly
into his coat pocket and resumed
his gloomy inspection of the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“What did you do then?” demanded
seven-year-old curiosity.</p>

<p>“Earned another slice of bread and
butter; though why I should earn it, or
eat it when it is earned, is more than I
know.”</p>

<p>The boy seemed to ponder on this for
a while and then, evidently finding it
beyond him, gave it up.</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What you drawed with that pencil.”</p>

<p>“What I drew with this pencil?”
Gilbert parried, for the sake of hearing
him talk.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not!”</p>

<p>The child drew nearer and stood leaning
against his knee as he sat on a low
slab of rock. They looked steadily into
each other’s eyes. There was something
irresistibly winning in the little
fellow’s fearlessness and sociable intent.
Graham lifted his hand and brushed the
close-cropped head with gentle touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Poor little chap!” he said, huskily.</p>

<p>“Why’d you say that?” the boy asked
curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, because some day you’ll grow up
and—well, I hope you won’t make a
mess of it, as I have!”</p>

<p>“What’s make-a-mess-of-it?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” Graham demanded, “are
you a walking interrogation point?”</p>

<p>“I’m Gerald Hammond Fitzgerald,”
the boy answered with dignity.</p>

<p>“Glad to make your acquaintance,
Gerald Hammond Fitzgerald.” If Graham
smiled inwardly, no shade of amusement
crossed his face.</p>

<p>“’Me see it!” the little fellow pleaded.</p>

<p>“Say, you’ve got a fair share of persistence
of your own, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>The artist drew the sketch from his
pocket. He liked this small boy who
leaned so confidently against his knee.
Gerald glanced at the outline of himself
and his full, childish laugh of pleasure
rang out.</p>

<p>“Draw me some more with that pencil,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he pleaded, as though he thought
the lead possessed some wonderful charm
of its own.</p>

<p>“Tickles your vanity, does it? Well,
here goes! Put down that pail. Now
take your spade in both hands and stoop
over as if you were digging.”</p>

<p>The boy obeyed at once, striking
a perfectly natural attitude. Graham
made a more elaborate drawing this
time, throwing in a background of sea
and sky with quick, masterful strokes.
It occurred to him to put the suggestion
of a storm-cloud rising in the distance,
but he refrained. Somehow, he did not
want to connect storm-clouds with the
child.</p>

<p>“That will do for the front cover of
<i>Prescott’s Weekly</i>,” he thought as he
finished it.</p>

<p>Gerald was plainly delighted with the
result.</p>

<p>“When I grow up,” he announced,
“I’ll do what you do.”</p>

<p>“God forbid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The words escaped Gilbert Graham’s
lips, in a low breath, ere he was aware.</p>

<p>Gerald regarded him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t—isn’t that <i>good</i>?” he questioned,
pointing to the drawing.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, yes, that’s good enough.”</p>

<p>“Then God wouldn’t forbid it!” the
child declared triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean—that kind of thing,”
the man said. He looked more intently
at the boy. “How do you know, at your
age, what God would or would not forbid?”</p>

<p>The child seemed to turn this question
over in his mind for a moment and, evidently
finding it too much for his comprehension,
fell back on something of
which he felt quite sure.</p>

<p>“‘God is love’—‘unfailing, quick,’” he
said, looking off over the sea, and unconsciously
mixing up two things which
he had learned at different times.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned and faced his companion
fully.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know about ‘a very present
help’?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Can’t say that I do, though it sounds
familiar. Do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I’ve always known about
it.”</p>

<p>He inspected Gilbert Graham gravely,
as though he were an entirely new type
of being—as indeed he was to Gerald.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know about ‘a very
present help,’” he began, “what would
you do if—if—” he looked around, and
finally took his illustration from the thing
closest at hand—“if a big, oh, a big,
<i>big</i> wave—” extending his arms to their
utmost limit to express vastness—“was
to come and sweep you away?”</p>

<p>“Drown, I suppose, seeing that I’m
no great swimmer. What would you
do?”</p>

<p>“I’d just <i>know</i> ‘God is love’—‘unfailing,
quick.’”</p>

<p>“And you think that would save
you?”</p>

<p>The child nodded confidently.</p>

<p>“It saved my mamma, right here.
And it saved my daddy, too. Only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
wave that swept my daddy out was on
a diff’rent kind of sea from this sea.”</p>

<p>“A different kind of sea?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was a sea called sin.”</p>

<p>The man started and looked quickly
away from the child. It was some moments
before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Did the wave sweep your daddy
very far out?” he asked then, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I know, for I heard my
daddy telling a man about it just a few
days ago—I think a big wave must have
swept him out, too—and he said he was
like a boat that had slipped its—its—”</p>

<p>“Moorings?”</p>

<p>Gerald nodded.</p>

<p>“And drifted ’way out to sea,” he
went on, “and ’twas black and cold and
rough and daddy began to think of the
shore and that gran’ma was there—’twas
before he had mamma and me—and
he cried out to the ‘very present
help.’ I don’t think daddy knew, ‘God
is love’—‘unfailing, quick’ then, or he’d
have said it out loud like I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“And was he—saved?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>Gilbert Graham sat silent, one hand
shading his eyes. Gerald watched him
for a few minutes, then, with a child’s
curiosity, reached up and drew away
one of the strong, supple fingers. He
was surprised to find that it was wet.</p>

<p>“Little chap—” the man’s voice
caught in his throat as he put one arm
round the boy—“I don’t mind telling
<i>you</i> that I’m out on that same sea—far
out, farther out than your daddy ever
was, and it’s dark and cold and rough
and—” his forehead fell back upon his
hand—“I think that I’m going to sink!”</p>

<p>Gerald laid one moist, warm palm
against his cheek.</p>

<p>“But you can’t sink!” he declared.
“The ‘very present help’ won’t let you
sink, if--if you catch hold of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how,” the man groaned,
“I’ve lost my grip.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t <i>your</i> grip,” the boy urged,
“the water’d loosen that, anyhow. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
know, for I’ve tried holding on to a rock
and when a wave comes it always makes
you let go. But the ‘very present help’
never lets go. It’s God, you know.
And if God let go the sun would fall
down and the stars would fall down
and we’d all fall down, mamma says.
But He never does, and so there’s nothing
to be afraid of.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be afraid of!” Graham
repeated.</p>

<p>Oh, the blessedness of childhood!
Some words came back to the man as
he sat there—“a great gulf fixed.” It
seemed to him that there was, indeed,
a great gulf fixed, a well-nigh impassable
flood, between the fearless thought of
this child and the dark clamor and confusion
of his own consciousness.</p>

<p>“Mamma was telling me more about
the sea last night,” Gerald went on.
“She says there’s lots of diff’rent kinds
of seas. Some of them have very big
names. There’s one that begins with
‘Dif—’ but I don’t remember the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Difficulty?” Graham suggested. In
spite of himself the boy kept dragging
him out of his slough of despair.</p>

<p>Gerald nodded.</p>

<p>“Do you know about that sea?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I ought to; I’ve been tossed about
on it often enough.”</p>

<p>“And there’s one that ends in ‘row.’
I remember that because row made me
think of a boat.”</p>

<p>“Sorrow?” Graham asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know about that one,
too?”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to know about that
one.”</p>

<p>“I know about the sick sea, myself!”
Gerald declared.</p>

<p>“So do I,” Graham admitted.</p>

<p>“And then there’s the one daddy was
nearly drowned in, the one you said you
were far out on. But mamma says it
doesn’t matter a bit what the name is,
or how rough it is, or how far from shore
you are, Love can walk over any sea
and come and get you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Gilbert Graham was looking at the
boy with an intent, earnest gaze. Was
the gulf so fixed, so impassable, after all?
Suppose there was a Power which could
cross it and come to a man in his extremity?</p>

<p>“When I was out on the sick sea,”
Gerald went on, “and my head was so
wobbly that I didn’t know daddy or
mamma, Love came and got me, right
away. Oh, but ’twas fine when my
head didn’t feel wobbly any more!”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get it all
started?” Graham asked.</p>

<p>The child evidently did not grasp his
meaning, so he put it in another way.</p>

<p>“Supposing I wanted this ‘very present
help’—wanted it now—wanted it
badly—what would I have to do to get
it started toward me?”</p>

<p>“Just <i>know</i> that you want it. My
mamma says another word for ‘know,’
but ’tis a long one and I misremember
it.”</p>

<p>“Believe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>“Realize?”</p>

<p>“That’s it!”</p>

<p>“Realize that I need ‘a very present
help,’” Gilbert Graham said slowly, as
he gazed out to sea, “well, I do need it;
and if ever a man realized his need I
think I do at this moment!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s coming—it’s coming oh,
so quick! First thing you know the
‘very present help’ will have hold of
you, just like that!” and Gerald’s brown
fingers closed firmly on the collar of
Graham’s coat.</p>

<p>Gilbert Graham patted the small hand
and then held it for some time between
both his own. When he rose, something
that had been in his face before he began
to talk to the child—marring its beauty
and manhood—was gone. He was not,
as yet, aware that his declaration, “If
ever a man realized his need I think I
do at this moment,” was the opened door
through which Love had entered, issuing
as it came the wondrous command,
“Loose him and let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>He released the boy’s hand regretfully.</p>

<p>“You going away?” Gerald looked
up wistfully into the dark, clean-shaven
face.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“For always?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll come back. That is—I’ll
come back if what you’ve been telling
me is true and I reach shore.”</p>

<p>He had gone a little distance along the
beach when a childish voice reached
him.</p>

<p>“When you come back will you draw
me some more with that pencil?”</p>

<p>The artist turned to nod assent. At
sight of the small figure, so sturdy, such
a living embodiment of the Love in
which he so firmly trusted, his vision
clouded.</p>

<p>“He’s near enough to—” Gilbert Graham
hesitated before mentally pronouncing
the next word—“God to reclaim
even me!”</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SORROW SEA</p>


<p>“I don’t know why I came!”</p>

<p>There was a low throb of pain in the
younger woman’s voice. For answer the
elder pressed her hand more closely.</p>

<p>“When I think of that summer two
years ago,” the speaker went on, “and
how Gilbert and the child and I used
to romp on this very strip of sand, I
marvel that I can be here, alone, and
still live!”</p>

<p>The soft, elderly palm, which covered
her own, quivered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Graham, forgive me!”
she said, turning quickly. “I am selfish
in my sorrow—I know it. And I
keep forgetting that <i>he</i> was once your
little boy, even as the baby was mine.”</p>

<p>“He is my little boy still—and always
will be,” Gilbert Graham’s mother answered
steadily.</p>

<p>“Do not think, Judith,” she added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“that I condone the past, or make light
of what you have suffered. I am sure
you know, my dear, that my chief object
in life, just now, is to help you.”</p>

<p>“I do know it. I could not have endured
these past months if you had not
let me come to you.”</p>

<p>They sat for some time in silence.</p>

<p>“Our little man was just two years
old the summer that we spent here at
Snug Harbor Beach,” Judith Graham
said, presently. “I remember how Gilbert
used to carry him out on his shoulder
and how he would shriek with delight
when the water swept in round his
father’s knees. It seems to me now that
those weeks were my very last gleam of
sunshine. To think that in less than
two months from that time my baby
was dead!”</p>

<p>The older woman made no attempt to
stem this outburst of grief. Youth must
make its plaint, she thought pitifully;
and the girl—she was little more—at her
side was one of those who are capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
receiving death-wounds through the very
completeness of their love.</p>

<p>“Of late,” she said, after a while, speaking
in a low tone, “it has seemed to me
that this cannot be the end, Judith, either
for you or Gilbert. I have been thinking
much of God’s all-loving, all-wise
plan for each one of us, and how we
seem to draw back from it, even to
dread it; whereas, in reality, it can
hold nothing but happiness for every
creature. I wish—oh, I wish with all
my heart that I had thought of these
things earlier in life, while Gilbert was
still a boy! But then I was so proud
of his good looks, of his popularity, of his
talent for drawing, that I unconsciously
made the turning aside into easier paths
his rule of living. It has been the old
story—no restraining father’s hand, an
over-fond mother and an impressionable
boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Graham, <i>don’t</i>,” Judith
said quickly. “If you blame yourself,
what about me? He never touched—it—”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
she stopped, shuddering—“until
after baby went. I shut myself up then,
alone with my grief. I spent hours just
looking at his little clothes. I accused
Gilbert of not caring. It seemed to me
that all the world should have stood
still and mourned with me. I was mad,
I think. Too late I realized that misery
and loneliness are open doors through
which temptation may freely enter. To
me the indulgence of grief was a luxury.
To Gilbert the sight of a small shoe or
toy was agony. Men are so different!
Little by little he began to drift away
from the cold, empty, silent place that
had once been home.”</p>

<p>The older woman did not reply. Hers
was the blame, her heart cried out, hers
alone! Had she ever taught her son
that problems are not solved by shirking
them? Had she fitted him to face the
world’s woe unflinchingly and do a man’s
share toward lifting it? Ah, that “line
of least resistance” which she had made
so natural for him! She realized now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
that it is swimming against the current
which develops moral muscle—the muscle
which can resist temptation in after
years. The mother bowed her head with
an inarticulate cry, “Oh, God, I have
failed, but Thy resources are infinite!”</p>

<p>She put her own sorrow, her own
sense of failure, bravely aside in order
to help her companion.</p>

<p>“It is hard, I know, to believe—when
the sky is as dark as yours seems to be
now, Judith, that it will ever be any
brighter, but every day it becomes
clearer to me that God’s law is a law of
annihilation to every discordant condition.
It does make the crooked straight
and the rough places plain. It will, if
we rely wholly upon it, bring harmony
and order out of seeming chaos. God
did not create us, His children, to be
driven by every wind and wave of disaster.
When we begin to discern this
great truth it is, indeed, the coming of
the kingdom of heaven to our consciousness.
I have thought so often, of late,
of those beautiful lines—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tears had risen so full in Judith’s
dark eyes as Mother Graham finished
speaking that she was not at first aware
of a small figure which had halted directly
in front of her, or of a childish
gaze fixed intently upon her face. Gerald,
realizing that here was need of
some kind, drew nearer.</p>

<p>“You can’t know about it either, or
you wouldn’t cry,” he began.</p>

<p>“Know about what, dear?”</p>

<p>Judith had taken one small, brown
hand and drawn him closer to her. He
was three years older than her own little
son would have been, had he lived, but
her heart yearned over him as it did over
all children now.</p>

<p>“About ‘God is love’—‘unfailing,
quick.’”</p>

<p>Coming so closely upon what Mother
Graham had said the child’s words were
almost a shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“<i>He</i> didn’t know about it until I
told him,” Gerald volunteered.</p>

<p>“Who?” Both women put the question
together.</p>

<p>“The man that drawed me with a
pencil.”</p>

<p>They turned and looked at each other
involuntarily. Each had a mental picture
of a strong, supple hand and its
quick, masterful work when anything
appealed to the artistic sense controlling
it.</p>

<p>“Do you mean a man who drew a
picture of you?” Mother Graham asked.</p>

<p>Gerald nodded.</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Over near that rock.” He pointed
with an extended forefinger.</p>

<p>“Did he tell you his name?”</p>

<p>A vigorous shake of the head answered
this.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could tell us what
he looked like?”</p>

<p>“He looked sorry, until I told him
about the ‘very present help’ and ‘God
is love’—‘unfailing, quick.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Judith’s breath was coming with difficulty.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be—it couldn’t,” she whispered.
“And, yet, he might have been
drawn back to this place, even as I was!”</p>

<p>“I think that it was Gilbert,” Mother
Graham answered steadily. “‘<i>All</i> things
work together for good,’ Judith; remember
that, dear, and take courage.”</p>

<p>“He’s coming back,” Gerald announced.</p>

<p>Judith started and looked around.</p>

<p>“When?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“He said if what I told him about ‘a
very present help’ was true he’d come
back; and <i>’tis</i> true. Was he”—turning
to Mother Graham—“was he your little
boy?”</p>

<p>“I hope so—I believe so.”</p>

<p>“If he was your little boy you’d know
about the big wave that swept him out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that he could have been
my boy”—a shade of disappointment
had crossed the elder woman’s sweet,
patient face—“for I never knew of his
being swept away by a wave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t that kind of sea”—motioning
to the water behind him—“it
was a sea called sin and he said the wave
had carried him ’way, ’way out. He
knew about ’most every kind of sea.
But I told him my mamma said it didn’t
matter a bit what the sea was called,
Love could walk over it.”</p>

<p>Judith had covered her eyes with her
hand. Gerald touched her cheek with
one finger.</p>

<p>“Are you out on the sorry—sor-<i>row</i>”—correcting
himself carefully—“are you
out on that sea?”</p>

<p>“God knows I am!”</p>

<p>“Well, if I was you, I’d just <i>know</i> ‘God
is love’—‘unfailing, quick,’ right now.”</p>

<p>“Where did you learn all this?”
Mother Graham asked, for the child was
voicing thoughts which had been struggling
for recognition in her own consciousness
of late.</p>

<p>“My mamma told it to me. She tells
me something more about ‘a very present
help’ every day. And she says that
the ‘very present help’ was always here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
but that a long, long time ago people
forgot how much of a help it was; and
then a good woman found out how much
of a help it was and she put it in a book
so that other people might know, and
that’s how my mamma knows. Is this”—he
touched Judith’s face again—“your
little girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mother Graham answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“Then you can tell her about it, just
like mamma tells me!”</p>

<p>“I am only beginning to learn about
it myself, dear, in the same way that
your mamma learned; but I thank God
that I have even begun, and I think”—Mother
Graham laid one hand on Judith’s
shoulder—“that my little girl is
ready to learn also.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and”—he nodded confidently—“you
know Love can walk over the
sor-row sea just as easy as any other!”</p>

<p>Judith raised her wet face and drew
the boy into her arms.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she said slowly “that
you are God’s messenger to me.”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE BIG WAVE</p>


<p>Instead of staying the few weeks upon
which they had planned at Snug Harbor
Beach, Judith Graham and her husband’s
mother remained on for nearly two
months. Neither spoke to the other of
the secret hope which chained them to
the place, but each morning their eyes
swept the beach with eager expectancy
and each evening they said, “Perhaps,
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Judith often sat for hours on the low
slab of rock where her husband had made
the sketch of Gerald. Whenever he saw
her thus, Gerald would invariably leave
his play for a few minutes and lean against
her knee, just as he had leaned against
Gilbert’s. Sometimes neither of them
spoke and sometimes Judith would ask—without
removing her eyes from the
distant horizon—“Do you think he’ll
come back?” to which Gerald’s unvarying
response was, “Sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The moments when she was thus alone
with him soon became to Judith the part
of the day that counted. It seemed to
her that while she sat with one arm
round the boy, leaning her tired head
against the warmth of his small body,
the wounds which life had given her were
being silently healed. No matter which
way her path might lie, existence was no
longer the dreary thing that it had
been when she came to Snug Harbor
Beach. Was it possible that Love had,
indeed, walked over the sea of sorrow,
to that desolate waste of waters where
her bark drifted, and was saying, even
to her, “It is I, be not afraid”?</p>

<p>At the end of the seventh week a northeast
storm of unusual violence swept the
coast and Judith was compelled to remain
indoors for several days. She sat
much near the window, sometimes reading,
with deep interest, a small, leather-covered
book which Mother Graham
had recently purchased, and sometimes
gazing out at the storm-lashed ocean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
She thought how One had risen from
sleep and said to such a sea, “Peace,
be still.” That the Christ could speak
those words to-day with the same authority—was
speaking them, now, to
her storm-racked consciousness—daily became
a more assured and glorious fact.</p>

<p>When she again saw the strip of sandy
beach, which had grown so dear because
of its association with her own little son
and with Gerald, the only trace of the
recent storm was a heavy, sullen swell—called
by sailors “the old sea”—which
lifted and broke upon the shore, rushing
in with tremendous force. Although the
tide was out, Judith could not on this
morning seek her usual seat, so far-reaching
were the waves. She stood for some
minutes on a path which wound through
a maze of sweet fern and berry bushes,
watching Gerald who, because of three
days’ enforced absence from the sand,
was bent on building a wonderful pyramid.</p>

<p>“The tide’s turned,” an old sailor said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
in passing, “she’s coming in and she’ll
be pretty high.”</p>

<p>Judith, who liked these simple fisherfolk,
turned aside to talk with him for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>“Such a storm as we have had these
last few days is unusual at this time of
year, is it not?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” he drawled,
easily. “When it’s bin thick o’ fog outside,
as it has for a week past, it takes
a considerable breeze o’ wind to clear it
away.”</p>

<p>“And does the ‘breeze o’ wind’ always
leave such a swell as that?” Judith
asked, as a wave crashed shoreward.</p>

<p>“’Most always, after a no’theaster.
There’ll be a heavy undertow to-day.
Wouldn’t try any salt-water bathin’,
if I was you.”</p>

<p>When Judith faced the sea again, she
was surprised to see how the tide appeared
to have risen in so short a time, and how
much further in the waves were breaking.
One came so near to where Gerald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
still intent on his pyramid, dug steadily,
that she called out to him. Her voice,
however, was completely drowned in the
roar of the surf. With a slight stirring
of alarm she left the path and hurried
forward.</p>

<p>She had covered half the distance
which separated them when her breath
stopped, as though it had been blown
back down her throat. To her terrified
eyes the ocean seemed suddenly to lift
and hurl itself landward. Such waves
are not uncommon on the Massachusetts
or Maine coasts after a northeast storm,
with an incoming tide. Their force can
seldom be calculated.</p>

<p>It lifted Gerald as though he had been
a chip of wood, carrying him inland for
several yards. Then came the relentless
clutch of the undertow.</p>

<p>To Judith it was as though the very
heart in her body was being battered
and bruised as she watched those small
hands vainly battling against that
seething flood, while the wooden spade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
he had so recently grasped floated almost
to her feet. If the child were
caught under into the next wave, it
seemed as though all life must be crushed
out of him when it crashed upon the
shore. For a sickening moment everything
turned black before her eyes, but
she fought off the faintness, crying aloud,</p>

<p>“Oh, Thou ‘very present help’—now—now—<i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>And then, with a sob of thankfulness,
she saw that a man, strong and supple,
was beating his way through the water.
He reached the boy, grasped him and
held him high in his arms. When the
wave broke, the man’s head was submerged,
but the boy’s was not.</p>

<p>The mighty volume of water lifted
Gilbert Graham even as its predecessor
had lifted Gerald; but, as the force of
the wave spent itself, he realized with a
throb of thankfulness that his feet
touched bottom, for, as he had once told
the boy, he was not an expert swimmer.
Then came the rush of the undertow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>It seemed as though his body must
yield before it, burdened as he was with
the child. As he braced his strong
shoulders against the flood his whole
being was a cry for strength. All at
once, this thing became to him symbolic.
It was not alone for the boy’s life that
he fought, but for his own manhood. If
he could stand firm now without relaxing
his grip of the child, he felt that no wave
of temptation, no subtle under-current
of appeal could ever again sweep him off
his feet or loosen his grasp on goodness
and truth.</p>

<p>The old sailor, with whom Judith had
talked a few minutes before, came stumbling
down the beach toward her.</p>

<p>“He can’t make it—he can’t!” he
muttered, with shaking lips. “The next
wave’ll get ’em both!”</p>

<p>On it came—the proverbial “third
wave” which sailors know and dread.
Higher than either of its immediate
predecessors the swell rose. Judith laid
her hands upon her heaving breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“‘It shall not overflow thee—it shall
not overflow thee!’” she cried.</p>

<p>“She’s prayin’,” the fisherman thought.</p>

<p>She scarcely breathed during the moments
which followed. Then a cry of
joy escaped her. The wave broke ere
it reached Gilbert. The white flood
carried him with it as it rushed in and
left him on firm foothold. He staggered
slightly when he reached the dry sand
and the old sailor put out an arm to
steady him.</p>

<p>“If that wave hadn’t broke before it
reached ’em, ’twould ’a’ bin day-day to
’em both—boy an’ man,” he muttered
as he turned away.</p>

<p>Judith drew Gerald’s drenched little
body close to the warmth of her own.
The child’s eyes were wide open, but the
shock seemed to have suspended his
faculties.</p>

<p>“Darling, you are all right, aren’t
you?” she whispered.</p>

<p>He did not appear to hear, and Gilbert
sank on one knee beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Little chap”—he said, between labored
breaths—“you haven’t forgotten
about ‘a very present help,’ have you?”</p>

<p>A light swept over the child’s face, as
though something within him had waked
up.</p>

<p>“I—said it!” he gasped. “When—the
big wave—came—I said, ‘God is
love’—‘unfailing, quick.’ And then—you
got me!”</p>

<p>He drew a long, shuddering sigh and
looked up at Gilbert while Judith wiped
the water from his face.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very nice—when a big wave—sweeps
you out—is it?” he asked
confidentially.</p>

<p>“No,” Gilbert Graham answered, “it
isn’t very nice.”</p>

<p>He looked at his wife—a long look in
which a man’s deep repentance was laid
at her feet.</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said, “I have much to say
to you, if you will let me say it. But
we must get the boy home. That water
was pretty cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“I will take him,” Judith said.</p>

<p>“And will you wait for me here? I
want to speak to you on this strip of
beach. But, first, I must see if I cannot
get some dry clothing in the village.”</p>

<p>“Mother Graham is here,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Tell me where and I will go to her,”
the man said humbly.</p>

<p>As he turned away, Gerald caught his
hand. The natural life and color were
returning to his small face.</p>

<p>“When I get—my dry clothes on—will
you draw me—some more—with that
pencil?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“I surely will, son!”</p>

<p>Above his head the man and woman
looked at each other again and there
was a light on their faces like the dawning
of a new day. But neither voiced the
thought which was in both their minds—“And
a little child shall lead them.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
